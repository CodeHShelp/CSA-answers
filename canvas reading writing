System.out.println("Hello world."); - char int myVarName = 5; - intiger boolean imABoolean = true; - Boolean
double average = (int) floorTotal / currResidents; - Casting
numStrikeOuts +=1;
One time it could mater to have a double vs a int is when your doing exact measurements in an experiment

creating a new scanner object
 public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
     }
public int add(int x, int y)
{
    int sum = x + y;
    return sum;
}
One way I find math class I think is useful is the is that you can use math.random to make a dice as it produces random integers
its because string.length uses instance method while math.sqrt uses static method

a compound Boolean statement - boolean isSunny = noClouds &&  notNight;
boolean isSunny = (noClouds true) || (noNight true)
== compares two things in the same place of memory while .equals passes through paramaters.
== strings can cause problems because they don't check all memory leading to problems when it should be true

int i = 5;
System.out.println("Initiating countdown:");
while(i >= 0) {
  System.out.println(i + "...");
  i--;
}
this while loop prints a countdown from 5 
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
the while loop from before requires the parameter from before to go to down to 5 whilst this for loop initiates a variable of its own and depends on the variable being less then 10
for (int row = 1; row < 6; row++) {
    // Original loop inside
    for(int count = 1; count < 6; count++) {
        System.out.print(count * row + " " );
    }
    System.out.println();
}
this nested loop greatly increases the amount of rows and columns made
the kind of loop you would use to repeat till a user is correct is a while loop because while they are wrong it would be repeated.
